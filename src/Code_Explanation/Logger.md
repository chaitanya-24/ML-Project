This code snippet sets up logging in a Python script for recording information and messages. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Importing Required Modules:**
   - `logging`: The built-in Python module used for creating log messages.
   - `os`: The module for working with operating system functionalities.
   - `datetime`: The module for working with dates and times.

2. **Defining Log File Name and Path:**
   - The `LOG_FILE` variable is assigned the current date and time in a specific format (`'%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S'`) to create a unique log file name.
   - The `logs_path` variable is created using the `os.path.join` function to construct the path to the directory where logs will be stored. It's constructed using the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`) and the `LOG_FILE` name.
   - The `os.makedirs` function is used to create the log directory if it doesn't exist already. The `exist_ok=True` argument ensures that the directory is created only if it doesn't exist.

3. **Setting Up Logging Configuration:**
   - `LOG_FILE_PATH` is assigned the full path to the log file using the `logs_path` and `LOG_FILE` values.
   - `logging.basicConfig` is used to configure the logging settings.
   - The `filename` argument specifies the file to which log messages will be written, which is the `LOG_FILE_PATH`.
   - The `format` argument defines the format of the log messages. In this case, it includes the timestamp, line number, logger name, log level, and the log message itself.
   - The `level` argument specifies the minimum log level that will be recorded. In this case, it's set to `logging.INFO`, which means messages of this level and higher (e.g., `logging.INFO`, `logging.WARNING`, etc.) will be logged.

4. **Logging Initialization:**
   - The code inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).
   - It logs a message using the `logging.info` function. The message "Logging has started" is written to the log file.

In summary, this code sets up a logging configuration that writes log messages to a file with a timestamped name in a designated directory. The log messages include the timestamp, line number, logger name, log level, and the actual log message. This helps in tracking and recording important information, warnings, and errors during the execution of the script.

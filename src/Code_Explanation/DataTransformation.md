This code snippet is part of a data transformation process in an end-to-end data science project. Data transformation involves preparing and converting raw data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing Required Modules:**
   - `sys`: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter.
   - `dataclass`: A decorator used to create classes with default attributes.
   - `numpy as np`: A library for numerical computations.
   - `pandas as pd`: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `ColumnTransformer`: A class from scikit-learn used to apply different transformers to different columns of an array or dataframe.
   - `SimpleImputer`: A class from scikit-learn used to impute missing values.
   - `Pipeline`: A class from scikit-learn used to assemble several steps of a data transformation pipeline.
   - `OneHotEncoder`: A class from scikit-learn used to encode categorical features.
   - `StandardScaler`: A class from scikit-learn used to scale numerical features.
   - `CustomException`: A custom exception class defined in the `src.exception` module.
   - `logging`: A logger used for recording messages.
   - `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
   - `save_object`: A function from the `src.utils` module (not shown) used to save objects to a file.

2. **DataTransformationConfig Class:**
   - A data class that defines the configuration parameters for data transformation.
   - It includes the path to save the preprocessing object.

3. **DataTransformation Class:**
   - A class responsible for performing the data transformation process.
   - It initializes with an instance of `DataTransformationConfig`.

4. **get_data_transformer_object Method:**
   - A method that returns a preprocessor object for data transformation.
   - The method creates separate pipelines for numerical and categorical columns:
     - For numerical columns: It applies imputation with the median and scaling.
     - For categorical columns: It applies imputation with the most frequent value, one-hot encoding, and scaling.
   - The pipelines are combined into a `ColumnTransformer`.

5. **initiate_data_transformation Method:**
   - A method that performs the data transformation process.
   - It reads training and testing data from CSV files.
   - Obtains the preprocessing object using the `get_data_transformer_object` method.
   - Defines the target column name and numerical columns.
   - Separates input features and target features from the data.
   - Applies the preprocessing object on both training and testing input features.
   - Combines input features with target features.
   - Saves the preprocessing object using the `save_object` function.
   - Returns the transformed training and testing arrays along with the path to the saved preprocessing object.

In summary, this code defines a `DataTransformation` class responsible for applying data transformation techniques such as imputation, scaling, and encoding to prepare data for machine learning. The class can be used to transform input data and save the preprocessing object for future use. The code assumes the presence of other modules like `src.exception` and `src.utils`, which are not shown in this code snippet.

This code snippet defines a custom exception class named `CustomException` and a utility function `error_message_detail` for handling and logging exceptions in a more informative manner. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing Required Modules:**
   - `sys`: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter.
   - `src.logger.logging`: Imports the `logging` object from the `src.logger` module.

2. **`error_message_detail` Function:**
   - This function is designed to provide a detailed error message along with information about where the error occurred.
   - It takes two parameters: `error` (the exception object) and `error_detail` (an instance of `sys` module).
   - The function extracts information from the `exc_info()` method of the `error_detail` object, which contains the details of the current exception.
   - It retrieves the filename, line number, and error message from the exception information.
   - The detailed error message is formatted using these details and returned.

3. **CustomException Class:**
   - This is a custom exception class that inherits from the base `Exception` class.
   - The `__init__` method of this class takes two parameters: `error_message` (a user-provided error message) and `error_detail` (an instance of `sys` module).
   - Inside the `__init__` method:
     - It calls the parent class's `__init__` method with the provided `error_message`.
     - It calls the `error_message_detail` function to generate a detailed error message using the provided `error_message` and `error_detail`.
     - The detailed error message is stored in the `error_message` attribute of the class instance.

4. **`__str__` Method:**
   - This method overrides the `__str__` method inherited from the base `Exception` class.
   - It returns the stored detailed error message when the exception is converted to a string.

In summary, this code defines a custom exception class `CustomException` that enhances the way exceptions are handled by providing detailed error messages. It also contains a utility function `error_message_detail` that extracts exception details and formats them into an informative error message. This approach helps in improving error reporting and debugging in a more structured manner. The `logging` module is used to record these informative error messages.

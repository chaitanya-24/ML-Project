This code is part of an end-to-end data science project and focuses on the data ingestion process. Data ingestion involves gathering and importing data from various sources into a suitable format for further analysis and processing. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing Required Modules:**
   - `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
   - `sys`: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter.
   - `CustomException`: A custom exception class defined in the `src.exception` module.
   - `logging`: A logger used for recording messages.
   - `pandas as pd`: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `train_test_split`: A function from scikit-learn used for splitting datasets into training and testing subsets.
   - `dataclass`: A decorator used to create classes with default attributes.

2. **DataIngestionConfig Class:**
   - A data class that defines the configuration parameters for data ingestion.
   - It includes paths to the training data, testing data, and raw data.

3. **DataIngestion Class:**
   - A class responsible for performing the data ingestion process.
   - It initializes with an instance of `DataIngestionConfig`.
   - The `initiate_data_ingestion` method performs the following steps:
     - Reads a dataset from the file `'notebook\data\stud.csv'`.
     - Creates directories for storing the raw, training, and testing data if they don't exist.
     - Saves the raw data as a CSV file using the path specified in the config.
     - Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets using the `train_test_split` function.
     - Saves the training and testing subsets as CSV files using paths specified in the config.
     - Returns the paths of the saved training and testing data.

4. **Main Block:**
   - Creates an instance of the `DataIngestion` class.
   - Calls the `initiate_data_ingestion` method to perform data ingestion and get the paths of the training and testing data.
   - Initializes an instance of the `DataTransformation` class.
   - Calls the `initiate_data_transformation` method of the `DataTransformation` class, passing the training and testing data paths.

In summary, this code defines a `DataIngestion` class that reads a dataset, splits it into training and testing subsets, and saves them as CSV files. The main block then initiates data ingestion and subsequently initiates data transformation using the `DataTransformation` class.

Please note that the code assumes the presence of other modules like `src.exception`, `src.logger`, and `src.components.data_transformation` which are not shown in this code snippet. Also, there's a potential issue in the path `'notebook\data\stud.csv'` which might need to be corrected depending on the file's actual location.

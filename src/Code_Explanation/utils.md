This code snippet contains two utility functions: `save_object` and `evaluate_models`. These functions are used in an end-to-end data science project for saving objects and evaluating the performance of machine learning models. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Importing Required Modules:**
   - `os`, `sys`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system and accessing system-specific parameters.
   - `numpy` (`np` alias), `pandas` (`pd` alias): Libraries for numerical and data manipulation.
   - `dill`, `pickle`: Libraries for object serialization.
   - `r2_score`: A function from scikit-learn used to compute the R-squared score for regression models.
   - `CustomException`: A custom exception class defined in the `src.exception` module.

2. **save_object Function:**
   - A function that saves an object to a file using serialization.
   - Takes two parameters: `file_path` (path to the file to be saved) and `obj` (the object to be saved).
   - Creates the directory structure if it doesn't exist.
   - Opens the specified file in binary write mode.
   - Uses `dill.dump` to serialize and save the object to the file.

3. **evaluate_models Function:**
   - A function that evaluates the performance of machine learning models.
   - Takes four parameters: `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test` (the training and testing feature and target arrays), and `models` (a dictionary containing instances of machine learning models).
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `report` to store model performance results.
   - Iterates through the models dictionary.
   - For each model:
     - Fits the model on the training data.
     - Predicts the target values for both training and testing datasets.
     - Computes the R-squared scores for both training and testing predictions.
     - Stores the testing R-squared score in the `report` dictionary.
   - Returns the `report` dictionary containing the testing R-squared scores for each model.

Both functions are designed to handle potential exceptions by raising a custom exception (`CustomException`) defined in the `src.exception` module. This encapsulates error handling and improves code robustness.

In summary, these utility functions `save_object` and `evaluate_models` are used to save Python objects to files using serialization and to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, respectively. These functions contribute to the broader data science project by facilitating object storage and model assessment.
